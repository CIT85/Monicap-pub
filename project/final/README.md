# Why I picked this Project.
I picked this subject for the project because I have always liked working in the business field. I currently work for a small business and plan to one day own one myself. This came to me easily because many of my family members are small busniess owners and i've learned a lot about it over the past 29 years of my life. I want to help others with the goal of a small business get the information they need on how to sucessfully start from the beginning. I have first hand seen the good and bad side of owning your own business dealing with taxes, irs, insurance, business licence requirements and it is over whelming.
# Prompts
Some prompts I used to get chat gpt to help me decide what topic to choose are: "help me choose a topic for my coding class project", "help me choose some topics and titles to cover the content i plan to create", "make this more simple for a someone new to planning a business"
# headings
* Home
* Goals
* Marketing

## sub page 
When creating my sub page i opted to create an anchor tag to link it to the page as not to crowd my navigation bar too much.
## MEDIA QUERIES
For this section I went with the tail wind option from dave grey i wanted to see how it was different from the bootstrap and the common one used.
## Overall
Tried my best to get a really responsive design.
