            <h2>Setting Your Marketing Budget</h2>
            <p>Determining how much to spend on marketing can be challenging. However, it is essential for business growth. Typically, small businesses allocate 5-10% of their revenue for marketing efforts.</p>
            <p>Here are some key budgeting tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Track and Measure Results:</strong> Make sure you measure the ROI (Return on Investment) of your marketing efforts to optimize your budget. Track website traffic, sales, and engagement rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Start Small, Scale Gradually:</strong> Start with a small marketing budget and increase it as you start seeing results. Invest more in the strategies that are yielding the best returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Leverage Free Resources:</strong> Use free marketing tools and platforms to build your online presence. Platforms like Google My Business, social media, and blogging can be very effective at little to no cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Paid Advertising:</strong> If your budget allows, paid ads can boost visibility. Platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads provide targeting tools to help you reach the right audience.</li>
            </ul>
