        <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
        <p>I am taking this class because I have always had an interest in the coding field. I have taken a few
            different coding courses with Rio Waller and they have always kept me interested. I am a business major
            and currently work for a small family business and we do alot of work in house. We will eventually be
            creating a new page which will most likely be my task to complete. I want to get more involved in coding
            and web development aside from that. Hopefully I can become as good as alot of the other students and
            professors that I am currently learning from.

        <h2>Expirience Using ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>Using ChatGTP was actually a pretty fun expirience as i was having alot of unsure feelings about what
            exactly to build my website based off. I gave it a few different narratives and ideas that I was
            considering and it helped me narrow it down to this websive i've created.It made the process much easier
            as a whole.</p>
